# Telegram Translation Bot (Microservices Architecture)

## Project Overview

This project is a Telegram bot designed for text translation using a microservices architecture, leveraging multiple programming languages (Python and Go) and deployed on AWS using Docker and Kubernetes (AWS EKS). The bot supports interactions with users for translating text, while backend services handle translation requests, user authentication, text processing, and monitoring.

## Key Features

- **Telegram Bot**: Receives user input, forwards it to the translation service, and returns the translated text.
- **Translation Service**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 Omni Mini for translating text and returns results to the bot.
- **Text Processing Service**: Performs spelling, grammar checks, and adapts translations for different audiences.
- **User Authentication**: Manages user accounts and supports social logins with JWT-based authentication.
- **Analytics and Monitoring**: Collects user activity data, tracks performance metrics, and logs requests using Prometheus, Grafana, and EFK Stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana).
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Built using Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration, ensuring scalability and reliability.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python, Go, Java
- **Infrastructure**: AWS EKS, Docker, Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, EFK Stack
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Security**: Kubernetes Secrets, JWT-based authentication
- **External API**: OpenAI GPT-4 for translation

## How to Deploy

1. Clone the repository.
2. Build Docker images for each service using the provided `Dockerfile`.
3. Apply Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service, Ingress) to deploy services to AWS EKS.
4. Set up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring, and EFK Stack for logging.
5. Follow the documentation for service deployment, monitoring, and scaling.
